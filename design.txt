Step 1 Design the Decision Tree Structure:

Define the structure of a tree node (e.g., attributes for splitting criteria, left/right child pointers, leaf labels).

Attribute for splitting: Gini Index
Leaf nodes: Survied vs Not Survived

Outline the design of the tree-building process (e.g., recursive splitting, stopping conditions).
Binary splitting but if there's a node that has more than 2 options split two by two like 1, 2, 3 -> 1 and 2, 3 and then 1, 2

Step 2: Implement the Tree-Building Algorithm
Input: Titanic data set

1.)Write a function to calculate impurity (e.g., Shannon entropy or Gini index).
~Gini Index

2.) Implement a recursive function to split data based on impurity reduction and grow the tree.
