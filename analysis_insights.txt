1. Identifies overfitting/underfitting issues.
- For the split method, overfitting and underfitting issues will both occur
depending on the hyperperameters of max depth and min samples. Setting max depth
too high means the tree basically memorizes the patterns of the training data
and tries to apply it to the other datasets. The same goes for setting minimum
samples too low. On the contrary, setting max depth too low or min samples too
high means the tree stops before it can learn enough about the data to detect
patterns. The specifics of too much or too little of these parameters will be
covered in the next question.

2. Discusses the impact of hyperparameters like depth, splits, etc.


3. Provides recommendations for improvement
- For the split method:
  - more complex ways of splitting can used, rather than basing it off the most
  common value for better accuracy. This could include utilizing individual
  ginis of specific attribute values to decide how the split works
